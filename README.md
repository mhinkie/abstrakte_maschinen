Comparison of stack and register implementations of interpreters for a subset of PHP.
The interpreter were tested using predefined php-files (fib.php, prime.php...)

Version 1 interpreters with ability to record command runtimes.

### v2
Version 2: New stack interpreter (reduced command set - no block entries or exists) written in GO.

### v3
Version 3: New stack interpreter - this time written in C using direct threaded code.
